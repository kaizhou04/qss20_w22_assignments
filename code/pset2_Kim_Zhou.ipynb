You become interested in how the judge's own demographic attributes are correlated with sentencing.

Then, investigate whether disparities differ between \"likely female\" and \"likely male\" judges. \n",

But there are many valid ethical critiques of this practice. In the case of gender, a person's assigned name at birth clearly does not always map onto their self-identified gender, both due to genders beyond the binary of male/female and names like \"Morgan.\" A couple critiques I link to are:\n",
